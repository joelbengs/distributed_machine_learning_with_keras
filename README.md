Epilepsy affects more than 64 million people worldwide. The unpredictable nature of seizures can be life-threatening, causing epilepsy patients to have a 2-3 times higher mortality rate than healthy control groups.

In this project, we build ML models that can predict epileptic seizures by analyzing the incoming EEG signals and determining whether or not the patient has a seizure at a given time. The dataset is coming from four sensors in a pair of glasses that the patient can wear.

In lab 1, we build a Convolutional Neural Network that achieves an estimated >85% accuracy in generalization.
In lab 2, we build a Lightweight Machine Learning algorithm using Random Forests and feature processing. It achieves an estimated >90% accuracy in generalization.
In lab 3, you will use a low-power machine learning network suitable to run on wearable devices. This lab includes porting the model to an Arduino.
